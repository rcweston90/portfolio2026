## Why?

I love Spotify Wrapped but wanted:
- Access to it year-round
- More detailed stats
- Custom visualizations
- To learn the Spotify API

## Tech Stack

- Next.js for the frontend
- Spotify Web API for data
- D3.js for visualizations
- Vercel for hosting

## Cool Visualizations

### Listening Clock
A 24-hour radial chart showing when I listen to music throughout the day.

### Genre Evolution
How my music taste has evolved month by month.

### Artist Constellation
A force-directed graph connecting artists I listen to based on shared listeners.

## Challenges

The Spotify API has rate limits, so I had to implement smart caching and pagination.

## What I Discovered

Apparently I listen to the same 50 songs on repeat. 🎵
