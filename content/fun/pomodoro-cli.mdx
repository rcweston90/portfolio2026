## The Idea

I wanted a distraction-free pomodoro timer that lives in my terminal where I spend most of my time.

## Why Rust?

- Blazing fast startup time
- Small binary size
- Great CLI ecosystem (clap, crossterm)
- Wanted to learn something new!

## Features

- Beautiful TUI with progress bars and animations
- Desktop notifications when timer ends
- Stats tracking (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Customizable work/break durations
- Quiet mode for when you're in the zone

## What I Learned

Building CLI tools is surprisingly fun. Rust's ownership model made more sense after this project.

## Try It

```bash
cargo install pomo-cli
pomo start
```
