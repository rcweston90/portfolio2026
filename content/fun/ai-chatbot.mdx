## The Experiment

Wanted to understand LLMs beyond just using ChatGPT. Built a custom chatbot with personality.

## What I Built

A sarcastic coding assistant that:
- Answers questions about my codebase
- Has a distinct personality (helpful but sassy)
- Remembers conversation context
- Can search through my documentation

## Tech Stack

- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- LangChain for orchestration
- Pinecone for vector storage
- Next.js for the interface

## Interesting Findings

### Prompt Engineering is an Art
The difference between a good and bad prompt is huge. Spent hours tweaking system prompts.

### RAG is Powerful
Retrieval-Augmented Generation makes the bot actually useful for specific domains.

### Context Windows Matter
Had to implement smart chunking to fit relevant docs in context.

## Sample Interaction

**Me**: How do I add a new component?

**Bot**: Oh, you want to add ANOTHER component? Bold move. Anyway, check `/core/primitives/` for the pattern. Create a folder, add your tsx and types file, update the index. You know the drill. Or do you need me to hold your hand through it?

## What's Next

Experimenting with local models (Llama) to reduce API costs.
