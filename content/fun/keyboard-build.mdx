## The Rabbit Hole

It started with "I should get a better keyboard" and ended with soldering at 2am.

## The Build

### Components
- **PCB**: DZ60 RGB (hot-swap)
- **Case**: Tofu65 aluminum in navy blue
- **Switches**: Gateron Black Ink V2 (lubed)
- **Keycaps**: GMK Minimal
- **Stabilizers**: Durock V2 (lubed and clipped)

### Mods
- Tape mod on PCB
- PE foam mod
- Silicone dampener in case
- Band-aid mod on stabilizers

## The Process

1. Research (2 weeks of rabbit holes)
2. Ordering parts (shipping from multiple countries)
3. Lubing switches (took 4 hours for 70 switches)
4. Assembly (the fun part!)
5. Sound test and adjustments

## Sound Test

*thock thock thock*

It sounds perfect. Worth every hour spent.

## Lessons Learned

- Patience is key when lubing switches
- The keyboard community is incredibly helpful
- This hobby is dangerously addictive
- My wallet will never recover
