## The Challenge

Improving trial activation rates and converting users to Premium subscriptions while maintaining a focus on user value.

Through careful experimentation design, user research, and data analysis, I developed and tested growth experiments that effectively communicated the value of Premium features.

## Impact

- Increased Jira and Confluence Premium trial activations by 30%

- Designed and executed multiple growth experiments

## Key Learnings

Experimentation is key to understanding what resonates with users. Data-driven design decisions combined with user research lead to better outcomes.
