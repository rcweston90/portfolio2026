## Overview

As Design Lead for Data Direct at Northern Trust, I drove the redesign of a data-focused product within MS Excel's third-party plugin ecosystem to support clients in aggregating large data sets.

## The Challenge

Clients needed a better way to aggregate and work with large data sets within their existing Excel workflows.

## The Solution

By redesigning the Excel plugin interface and improving data aggregation capabilities, we created a more intuitive and powerful tool for clients.

## Impact

- Drove redesign of data-focused product within MS Excel's third-party plugin ecosystem
- Supported clients in aggregating large data sets
- Improved user experience within familiar Excel environment

## Key Learnings

Designing within existing ecosystems (like Excel) requires understanding user workflows and constraints. Sometimes the best solution works within existing tools rather than replacing them.
